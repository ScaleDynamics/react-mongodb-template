## Why this folder ?

This folder contains the files generated by the ScaleDynamics Platform from your backend. You can import the backend you want into your component and use it. You can see the documentation [here](https://docs.scaledynamics.com/docs/use-in-browser-builder).

If you want to do customs folder inside this one, don't forget to add the files insides to your `.gitignore`.
